        With that Prohibition loaded cane—<br />
        All this before I shot him.<br />

        My lawyer, Kinsey Keene, was helping to land<br />

        For all my wisdom and grace of mind<br />
        Gave her no delight at all, in very truth,<br />

        You cannot lift yourself to its rim<br />

        One day while arguing so, watching the cow<br />

        The white men played all sorts of jokes on me.<br />
        They took big fish off my hook<br />
        And put little ones on, while I was away<br />
        Getting a stringer, and made me believe<br />
        I hadn’t seen aright the fish I had caught.<br />
        When Burr Robbins, circus came to town<br />
        They got the ring master to let a tame leopard<br />
        Into the ring, and made me believe<br />
        I was whipping a wild beast like Samson<br />

        Yet everyone of you, you white men,<br />

        And you didn’t know any more than the horse-shoes did<br />

        Your devoted friendship and delicate ministrations<br />
        First with diminished thanks,<br />
        Afterward by gradually withdrawing my presence from you,<br />
        So that I might not be compelled to thank you,<br />
        And then with silence which followed upon<br />
        Our final Separation.<br />
        You had cured my diseased soul.<br />
        But to cure it<br />
        You saw my disease, you knew my secret,<br />
        And that is why I fled from you.<br />
        For though when our bodies rise from pain<br />
        We kiss forever the watchful hands<br />
        That gave us wormwood, while we shudder<br />
        For thinking of the wormwood,<br />
        A soul that’s cured is a different matter,<br />
        For there we’d blot from memory<br />
        The soft-toned words, the searching eyes,<br />
        And stand forever oblivious,<br />
        Not so much of the sorrow itself<br />
        As of the hand that healed it.

        And eke out a living repairing guns<br />
        Look at my moulds! My architectonics<br />
        One for a barrel, one for a hammer<br />
        And others for other parts of a gun!<br />
        Well, now suppose no gun-smith living<br />
        Had anything else but duplicate moulds<br />
        Of these I show you—well, all guns<br />
        Would be just alike, with a hammer to hit<br />
        The cap and a barrel to carry the shot<br />
        All acting alike for themselves, and all<br />
        Acting against each other alike.<br />
        And there would be your world of guns!<br />
        Which nothing could ever free from itself<br />

        I wore across the lot where now stands the opera house<br />
        Hasting with swift feet to work through many years?<br />
        Take its meaning to heart:<br />
        You too may walk, after the hills at Miller’s Ford<br />
        Seem no longer far away;<br />
        Long after you see them near at hand,<br />
        Beyond four miles of meadow;<br />
        And after woman’s love is silent<br />
        Saying no more: “I will save you.”<br />
        And after the faces of friends and kindred<br />
        Become as faded photographs, pitifully silent,<br />
        Sad for the look which means:<br />
        “We cannot help you.”<br />
        And after you no longer reproach mankind<br />
        With being in league against your soul’s uplifted hands—<br />
        Themselves compelled at midnight and at noon<br />
        To watch with steadfast eye their destinies;<br />
        After you have these understandings, think of me<br />
        And of my path, who walked therein and knew<br />
        That neither man nor woman, neither toil,<br />
        Nor duty, gold nor power<br />
        Can ease the longing of the soul,<br />
        The loneliness of the soul!

        And rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding<br />
        And all the youths fastidious grew of dress;<br />
        Notes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve<br />
        Knew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged<br />
        About the hills that overlooked the river.<br />
        Then, since the mercy seats more empty showed,<br />
        One of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:<br />
        “The woman of Babylon is among us; rise<br />
        Ye sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”<br />
        So John Cabanis left the church and left<br />
        The hosts of law and order with his eyes<br />
        By anger cleared, and him the liberal cause<br />
        Acclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty<br />
        To vanquish A. D. Blood.<br />
        <br />
        But as the war<br />
        Waged bitterly for votes and rumors flew<br />
        About the bank, and of the heavy loans<br />
        Which Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss<br />
        In wheat, and many drew their coin and left<br />
        The bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk<br />
        Among the liberals of another bank<br />
        Soon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst<br />
        ’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed<br />
        And in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held<br />
        Wise converse and inspiriting debate.<br />
        <br />
        High on a stage that overlooked the chairs<br />
        Where dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub<br />
        Of Shakespeare, very like the hired man<br />
        Of Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,<br />
        Upon a drab proscenium outward stared,<br />
        Sat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,<br />
        By merit raised in ribaldry and guile,<br />
        And to the assembled rebels thus he spake:<br />
        “Whether to lie supine and let a clique<br />
        Cold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,<br />
        Devour our substance, wreck our banks and drain<br />
        Our little hoards for hazards on the price<br />
        Of wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath<br />
        The shadow of a spire upreared to curb<br />
        A breed of lackeys and to serve the bank<br />
        Coadjutor in greed, that is the question.<br />
        Shall we have music and the jocund dance,<br />
        Or tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam<br />
        These hills about the river, flowering now<br />
        To April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,<br />
        Or play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,<br />
        I ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er<br />
        And riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,<br />
        Shall we submit to have these youths and maids<br />
        Branded as libertines and wantons?”<br />
        <br />
        Ere<br />
        His words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”<br />
        Then rose a sound of moving chairs, as when<br />
        The numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;<br />
        And every head was turned, as when a flock<br />
        Of geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread<br />
        Rise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall<br />
        With riotous laughter, for with battered hat<br />
        Tilted upon her saucy head, and fist<br />
        Raised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.<br />
        Headlong she had been hurled from out the hall<br />
        Save Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,<br />
        Prevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.<br />
        Then, mid applause she hastened toward the stage<br />
        And flung both gold and silver to the cause<br />
        And swiftly left the hall.<br />
        Meantime upstood<br />
        A giant figure, bearded like the son<br />
        Of Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,<br />
        And spoke in thunder: “Over there behold<br />
        A man who for the truth withstood his wife—<br />
        Such is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood<br />
        Compelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”<br />
        <br />
        Quick<br />
        Before Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard<br />
        Obtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time<br />
        For clownish words, and trivial is our cause<br />
        If naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,<br />
        He who was erstwhile of the other side<br />
        And came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake<br />
        Than triumph for New England or Virginia.<br />
        And whether rum be sold, or for two years<br />
        As in the past two years, this town be dry<br />
        Matters but little— Oh yes, revenue<br />
        For sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!<br />
        I wish to God this fight were now inspired<br />
        By other passion than to salve the pride<br />
        Of John Cabanis or his daughter. Why<br />
        Can never contests of great moment spring<br />
        From worthy things, not little? Still, if men<br />
        Must always act so, and if rum must be<br />
        The symbol and the medium to release<br />
        From life’s denial and from slavery,<br />
        Then give me rum!”<br />
        <br />
        Exultant cries arose.<br />
        Then, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear<br />
        And vacillation and begun to speak,<br />
        The door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,<br />
        Breathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,<br />
        Entered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way<br />
        To arrest you all. And if you only knew<br />
        Who’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening<br />
        Beneath the window where the other side<br />
        Are making plans.”<br />
        <br />
        So to a smaller room<br />
        To hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew<br />
        Selected by the Chair; the Chair himself<br />
        And Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,<br />
        And Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,<br />
        Imanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James<br />
        And Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,<br />
        Carl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde<br />
        And Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,<br />
        And E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,<br />
        Benjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier<br />
        By Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,<br />
        And secretly conferred.<br />
        <br />
        But in the hall<br />
        Disorder reigned and when the marshal came<br />
        And found it so, he marched the hoodlums out<br />
        And locked them up.<br />
        <br />
        Meanwhile within a room<br />
        Back in the basement of the church, with Blood<br />
        Counseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,<br />
        Deep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins<br />
        And Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes<br />
        And Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,<br />
        A traitor to the liberals, who with lip<br />
        Upcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:<br />
        “Such strife about an insult to a woman—<br />
        A girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,<br />
        And others unrecorded. Some there were<br />
        Who frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule<br />
        Democracy achieved thereby, the freedom<br />
        And lust of life it symbolized.
        <br />
        Now morn with snowy fingers up the sky<br />
        Flung like an orange at a festival<br />
        The ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds<br />
        Poured forth the hostile forces, and the streets<br />
        Resounded to the rattle of the wheels<br />
        That drove this way and that to gather in<br />
        The tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains<br />
        Who manned the battle. But at ten o’clock<br />
        The liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls<br />
        The rival candidates growled and came to blows.<br />
        Then proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve<br />
        A word of warning. Suddenly on the streets<br />
        Walked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills<br />
        That looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.<br />
        No man of this degenerate day could lift<br />
        The boulders which he threw, and when he spoke<br />
        The windows rattled, and beneath his brows<br />
        Thatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,<br />
        His small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.<br />
        And as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked<br />
        A song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,<br />
        The champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned<br />
        To terrify the liberals. Many fled<br />
        As when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.<br />
        He passed the polls and with a playful hand<br />
        Touched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,<br />
        As though he were a child, the wall; so strong<br />
        Was hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.<br />
        For soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,<br />
        Close on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in<br />
        By Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,<br />
        To match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce<br />
        Three-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,<br />
        And with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed<br />
        And many wounded in the days before,<br />
        And no one feared.<br />
        <br />
        But when the hog-eyed one<br />
        Saw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,<br />
        The bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,<br />
        The song he rumbled lowered. Round and round<br />
        The court-house paced he, followed stealthily<br />
        By Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:<br />
        “Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!<br />
        Come, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!<br />
        Come, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!<br />
        Take out your gun, you duffer, give me reason<br />
        To draw and kill you. Take your billy out.<br />
        I’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”<br />
        But never a word the hog-eyed one returned<br />
        But trod about the court-house, followed both<br />
        By troops of boys and watched by all the men.<br />
        All day, they walked the square. But when Apollo<br />
        Stood with reluctant look above the hills<br />
        As fain to see the end, and all the votes<br />
        Were cast, and closed the polls, before the door<br />
        Of Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones<br />
        That echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:<br />
        “Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice<br />
        As when a wild boar turns upon the hound<br />
        That through the brakes upon an August day<br />
        Has gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one<br />
        Rushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike<br />
        And grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven<br />
        The frightened cries of boys, and yells of men<br />
        Forth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike<br />
        Moved this way and now that, drew in his head<br />
        As if his neck to shorten, and bent down<br />
        To break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;<br />
        ’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength<br />
        Striking his fists against the invulnerable chest<br />
        Of hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in<br />
        To part them, others stayed them, and the fight<br />
        Spread among dozens; many valiant souls<br />
        Went down from clubs and bricks.<br />
        <br />
        But tell me, Muse,<br />
        What god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?<br />
        With one last, mighty struggle did he grasp<br />
        The murderous hands and turning kick his foe.<br />
        Then, as if struck by lightning, vanished all<br />
        The strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side<br />
        Sank limp those giant arms and o’er his face<br />
        Dread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.<br />
        And those great knees, invincible but late,<br />
        Shook to his weight. And quickly as the lion<br />
        Leaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike<br />
        Smite with a rock the temple of his foe,<br />
        And down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes<br />
        Passed like a cloud.<br />
        <br />
        As when the woodman fells<br />
        Some giant oak upon a summer’s day<br />
        And all the songsters of the forest shrill,<br />
        And one great hawk that has his nestling young<br />
        Amid the topmost branches croaks, as crash<br />
        The leafy branches through the tangled boughs<br />
        Of brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one<br />
        Amid the lamentations of the friends<br />
        Of A. D. Blood.<br />
        <br />
        Just then, four lusty men<br />
        Bore the town marshal, on whose iron face<br />
        The purple pall of death already lay,<br />
        To Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.<br />
        And cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound<br />
        Of running feet from every side was heard<br />
        Bent on the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A.

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight!

Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you?

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight!

Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells?

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight!

Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A.

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A.

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells?

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you?

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight!

Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A.

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A.

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells?

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered.

Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells?

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you?

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight!

Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A.

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight!

Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A.

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight!

Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells?

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight!

Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells?

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight!

Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells?

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight!

Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A.

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight!

Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells?

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight!

Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you?

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A.

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight!

Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you?

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight!

Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you?

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight!

Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A.

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight!

Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you?

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight!

Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A.

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered.

Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance.

Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells?

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered.

Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you?

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells?

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight!

Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells?

Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight!

Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight.

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen.

Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

Blood\nCompelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”\n\nQuick\nBefore Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard\nObtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time\nFor clownish words, and trivial is our cause\nIf naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,\nHe who was erstwhile of the other side\nAnd came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake\nThan triumph for New England or Virginia.\nAnd whether rum be sold, or for two years\nAs in the past two years, this town be dry\nMatters but little— Oh yes, revenue\nFor sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!\nI wish to God this fight were now inspired\nBy other passion than to salve the pride\nOf John Cabanis or his daughter. Why\nCan never contests of great moment spring\nFrom worthy things, not little? Still, if men\nMust always act so, and if rum must be\nThe symbol and the medium to release\nFrom life’s denial and from slavery,\nThen give me rum!”\n\nExultant cries arose.\nThen, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear\nAnd vacillation and begun to speak,\nThe door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,\nBreathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,\nEntered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way\nTo arrest you all. And if you only knew\nWho’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening\nBeneath the window where the other side\nAre making plans.”\n\nSo to a smaller room\nTo hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew\nSelected by the Chair; the Chair himself\nAnd Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,\nAnd Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,\nImanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James\nAnd Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,\nCarl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde\nAnd Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,\nAnd E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,\nBenjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier\nBy Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,\nAnd secretly conferred.\n\nBut in the hall\nDisorder reigned and when the marshal came\nAnd found it so, he marched the hoodlums out\nAnd locked them up.\n\nMeanwhile within a room\nBack in the basement of the church, with Blood\nCounseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,\nDeep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins\nAnd Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes\nAnd Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,\nA traitor to the liberals, who with lip\nUpcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:\n“Such strife about an insult to a woman—\nA girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,\nAnd others unrecorded. Some there were\nWho frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule\nDemocracy achieved thereby, the freedom\nAnd lust of life it symbolized.\n\nNow morn with snowy fingers up the sky\nFlung like an orange at a festival\nThe ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds\nPoured forth the hostile forces, and the streets\nResounded to the rattle of the wheels\nThat drove this way and that to gather in\nThe tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains\nWho manned the battle. But at ten o’clock\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\nThen proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\nTo terrify the liberals. Many fled\nAs when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.\nHe passed the polls and with a playful hand\nTouched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,\nAs though he were a child, the wall; so strong\nWas hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.\nFor soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,\nClose on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in\nBy Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,\nTo match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce\nThree-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,\nAnd with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\nAnd no one feared.\n\nBut when the hog-eyed one\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\nThe bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,\nThe song he rumbled lowered. Round and round\nThe court-house paced he, followed stealthily\nBy Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:\n“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\nI’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\nAll day, they walked the square. But when Apollo\nStood with reluctant look above the hills\nAs fain to see the end, and all the votes\nWere cast, and closed the polls, before the door\nOf Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones\nThat echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:\n“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice\nAs when a wild boar turns upon the hound\nThat through the brakes upon an August day\nHas gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one\nRushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike\nAnd grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\n’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\n\nBut tell me, Muse,\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\nThe strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side\nSank limp those giant arms and o’er his face\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\nAnd down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes\nPassed like a cloud.\n\nAs when the woodman fells\nSome giant oak upon a summer’s day\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\nOf A. D. Blood.\n\nJust then, four lusty men\nBore the town marshal, on whose iron face\nThe purple pall of death already lay,\nTo Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire.\nAnd cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound\nOf running feet from every side was heard\nBent on the\n",

His daughter Flossie, she,\nReturning from her wandering with a troop\nOf strolling players, walked the village streets,\nHer bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings\nAnd words of serpent wisdom and a smile\nOf cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,\nWho ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,\nMade known his disapproval of the maid;\nAnd all Spoon River whispered and the eyes\nOf all the church frowned on her, till she knew\nThey feared her and condemned.\n\nBut them to flout\nShe gave a dance to viols and to flutes,\nBrought from Peoria, and many youths,\nBut lately made regenerate through the prayers\nOf zealous preachers and of earnest souls,\nDanced merrily, and sought her in the dance,\nWho wore a dress so low of neck that eyes\nDown straying might survey the snowy swale\n’Till it was lost in whiteness.\n\nWith the dance\nThe village changed to merriment from gloom.\nThe milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill\nHer orders for new hats, and every seamstress\nPlied busy needles making gowns; old trunks\nAnd chests were opened for their store of laces\nAnd rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding\nAnd all the youths fastidious grew of dress;\nNotes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve\nKnew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged\nAbout the hills that overlooked the river.\nThen, since the mercy seats more empty showed,\nOne of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:\n“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise\nYe sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”\nSo John Cabanis left the church and left\nThe hosts of law and order with his eyes\nBy anger cleared, and him the liberal cause\nAcclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty\nTo vanquish A. D. Blood.\n\nBut as the war\nWaged bitterly for votes and rumors flew\nAbout the bank, and of the heavy loans\nWhich Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss\nIn wheat, and many drew their coin and left\nThe bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk\nAmong the liberals of another bank\nSoon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst\n’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed\nAnd in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held\nWise converse and inspiriting debate.\n\nHigh on a stage that overlooked the chairs\nWhere dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub\nOf Shakespeare, very like the hired man\nOf Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,\nUpon a drab proscenium outward stared,\nSat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,\nBy merit raised in ribaldry and guile,\nAnd to the assembled rebels thus he spake:\n“Whether to lie supine and let a clique\nCold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,\nDevour our substance, wreck our banks and drain\nOur little hoards for hazards on the price\nOf wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath\nThe shadow of a spire upreared to curb\nA breed of lackeys and to serve the bank\nCoadjutor in greed, that is the question.\nShall we have music and the jocund dance,\nOr tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam\nThese hills about the river, flowering now\nTo April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,\nOr play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,\nI ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er\nAnd riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,\nShall we submit to have these youths and maids\nBranded as libertines and wantons?”\n\nEre\nHis words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”\nThen rose a sound of moving chairs, as when\nThe numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;\nAnd every head was turned, as when a flock\nOf geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread\nRise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall\nWith riotous laughter, for with battered hat\nTilted upon her saucy head, and fist\nRaised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood.\nHeadlong she had been hurled from out the hall\nSave Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,\nPrevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard.\nThen, mid applause she hastened toward the stage\nAnd flung both gold and silver to the cause\nAnd swiftly left the hall.\nMeantime upstood\nA giant figure, bearded like the son\nOf Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,\nAnd spoke in thunder: “Over there behold\nA man who for the truth withstood his wife—\nSuch is our spirit—when that A.
